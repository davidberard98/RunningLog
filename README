On Linux:
  Install g++, wxWidgets, and make
    On Ubuntu: 'sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev libwxgtk2.8-dbg build-essential'
  run 'make' to compile

On Windows: (never tested this)
  Install cygwin, and make sure to include cvs, gcc-g++, and make in the installation.  Cygwin is a linux emulator that makes programming easier.
  Setup wxWidgets on cygwin, following these instructions: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Cygwin
  move 'Makefile.windows' to 'Makefile'
  run 'make' to compile.
