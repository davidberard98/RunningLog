On Linux:
  Install g++, wxWidgets, and make
    On Ubuntu: 'sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev libwxgtk2.8-dbg build-essential'
  run 'make' to compile

On Windows: (never tested this)
  Install cygwin, and make sure to include cvs, gcc-g++, and make in the installation.  Cygwin is a linux emulator that makes programming easier.
  Setup wxWidgets on cygwin, following these instructions: http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Cygwin
  move 'Makefile.windows' to 'Makefile'
  run 'make' to compile.

Dev to note:
  int StoreId = wxID_ANY; will just result in StoreId = -1, except it will actually assign -1 to be the ID, not a random number, so you end up with a whole bunch of objects with ID = -1.

To Do:
  -Correct weekPanel to use Dates
  -make weekPanel actually editable
    |Open a different frame
    |Store a list of seasons to make life easier
